# Google-Machines-Spark-Analysis
Author: Henrique Figueiredo Conte

## The project
The goal of this project is to analyse Google's large dataset using Apache Spark. The documentation of the dataset is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5g07T_gRDg9Z0lsSTEtTWtpOW8/view?resourcekey=0-cozD56gA4fUDdrkHnLJSrQ). 

The data is too big to be stored on the Github repository, therefore the Data folder isn't included here. To download it, please follow the instructions from the **Downloading the data** section from the documentation.
